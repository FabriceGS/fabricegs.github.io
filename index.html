			I like coding and politics. When I came to Brown University I knew I wanted to get involved in government. But I didn't know how. After I took my first CS class at Brown, I realized I really enjoyed coding and now I'm majoring in Political Science and Computer Science. All this is coming to a head in my biggest project to date: Bears@Work. As the founder and CEO of Bears@Work I am working with Governor Gina Raimondo to create real world, $15/hr internships for beginners in Brown CS.

			<p>When I'm not trying to create the next employment agency, I like to row boats (I walked on to Brown Men's Crew),  prosecute murderers in Brown Mock Trial as captain of my team and be an entrepreneur.

			Stanford students intern at Tesla and Apple in Palo Alto. University of Colorado students study at the Boulder Tech Center. And Brown students? We spread across the nation to find our internships. This is part of the reason approximately only 1 out of every 150 CS students stays in Rhode Island after graduation. 
			</p>

			<p>
			To fix this problem, I began the Bears@Work program: $15/hour real-world year-round coding internships in Rhode Island. The site is expected to go live in late October, with the first internships occuring in summer of 2018. Sign up: <a href="bearsatwork.brown.edu"> bearsatwork.brown.edu</a>.

			<p id="exp_text_2"> 
			In the summer of my freshman year I interned at the Rhode Island Executive Office of Commerce for Yale Law alumni, Secretary Stefan Pryor. Five years ago, Rhode Island had the highest unemployment rate in the nation at 11.2%. Now, thanks in large part to the work of the Executive Office of Commerce that number is down to 4.3%. I got to be a part of this mission at a critical juncture. 
			</p>

			<p>
			Every morning I would send reports on businesseses looking to expand to the Executive Leadership Team. I also developed a macro program to quickly analyze state business environments which our team now uses when convincing companies to move to Rhode Island (more information <a href="index.html#proj_header" onclick="openBattleCards();">here</a>). Finally, I wrote a law cutting red tape from the food truck licensing process by centralizing power with the state, R.I.G.L. 5.89.1 (more information <a href="index.html#proj_header" onclick="openFoodTrucks();">here</a>).

			<p id="exp_text_3"> The summer before my senior year at Lab, I worked for Neubauer Professor of Entrepreneurship Steven Kaplan at the Booth School of Business. There, I researched the effect of activist investors on executive compensation in Fortune 500 firms using Stata and Wharton's WRDS database. The somewhat surprising result was that in the year immediately succeeding an activist investor "event," executive compensation fell. But just two years later, compensation was at the same, if not higher levels that it had been.

				<h3> Food Trucks </h3>
			</div>

			<p id="rigl8951"> <a href="images/foodtruck.docx">File</a> </p>

			<p id="proj_text_2"> The licensing process in Rhode Island is so archaic that food trucks still operate under the same rules as "hawkers and peddlers" whereby every single municipality gets to make up its own rules about licenses. And some cities really go overboard. For example, in Cranston food trucks must stay 1,000 feet away from any eating establishment, carry a GPS tracking device and report twice daily to a commisary (<a href="http://ij.org/action-post/mobile-vending-hits-roadblocks-in-rhode-island/">read more</a> by the Providence Journal). All this makes it very hard for food trucks to set up shop in the state. And who doesn't like food trucks?</p>

			<p> To fix this, I wrote R.I.G.L. 5.89.1 which centralizes certain key aspects of the licensing process with the state, creating a one stop shop that provides food truck licenses which can be taken anywhere in the state.</p>

			<p> Our team encountered a problem however. There was no reliable database to compare state business environments and a sales team is only as good as its data.  I solved that problem with this program. A month long project--half of which was research and the other half of which was coding in VBA--the Battle Cards are an effective, easy to use program to view and effectively deploy relevant information in the field. This document is currently used by the Executive Office of Commerce when courting a business. </p>
